Exercise 2
In the course you learned how to do classificaiton using Fashion MNIST, a data set containing items of clothing. 
There's another, similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.

Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs 
-- i.e. you should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy.


Some notes:

It should succeed in less than 10 epochs, so it is okay to change epochs= to 10, but nothing larger
When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string "Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!"
If you add any additional variables, make sure you use the same names as the ones used in the class
